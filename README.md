# CS 327E - ELEMENTS OF DATABASES - Fall 2020
I took this class in the Fall of 2020 as one of the requirements for the Elements of Computing certificate at UT Austin. The code in this repository was compiled by myself and another classmate. In this class I learned about MySQL, Postgres, Spanner, Firestore, MongoDB, Neo4j, BigQuery, Apache Beam, and Dataflow. The projects found in this repo deal with concepts involved in the populating, querying, cleaning, and refactoring several different databases. The class was conducted over Zoom on Fridays from 4-7pm. Timed tests were administered to gague understanding of the topics in the class. The tests were multiple choice covering the concepts of databases in the unit and free response requiring the creation of the appropriate queries for the data and search result intended. A final project was completed in which my parter and I combed through datasets containing movie data from IMDB and Bollywood, refined and connected the two different datasets, and queried the data to reveal intricacies in the data.
